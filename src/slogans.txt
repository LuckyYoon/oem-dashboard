Engineering Tomorrow
Be On Edge
Niki we miss you
GP2 engine!
Speed. I am speed.
If you no longer go for a gap that exists, you're no longer a racing driver.
All the time you have to leave a space
Just leave me alone, I know what to do!
Smooooooooth Operatooooor
It's lights out and away we go!
I am stupid. I am stupid.
Simply lovely
You will not have the drink
If you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough.
Remember Senna
Ayrton Forever
Racing for Anthoine
Jules, forever in our hearts
#KeepFightingMichael
To finish first, first you must finish.
Smooth but Fast
Attack Every Corner
Driven with Purpose
There's a giant lizard on the track
The engine feels good, much slower than before... amazing
Bwoah
Gentlemen, a short view back to the past...
We are checking
Box, Box, Box.
Must be the water
I knew he'd brake, he has a wife and two kids at home.
He just turned into me!
Oh deer!
DU-DU-DU-DU, MAX VERSTAPPEN
We win and lose together
Being second is to be the first of the ones who lose.
Nothing, just an inchident.
No regrets. Only memories.
Full Send
Vamos!
It's more like a hobby for me.
I'm a high performance athlete.
Power is nothing without control
It's bwoken
Eat pasta, drive fasta
Engineered Insanity
Rest in Peace Roscoe
Standing on the shoulders of Giants
